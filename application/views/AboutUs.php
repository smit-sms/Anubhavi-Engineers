            		<h4 class="text-center description">
						In a developing country like India, where new startups are coming up day by day, there is an excess demand for engineering expertise. There are various small companies with great ideas who are not able to reach their complete potential, because they lack the technical experience to take their company to the next level. Parallelly, there is an increasing number of retired engineers who have immense knowledge and expertise in the industry. Then, we wonder, why aren’t these two groups working together? We at अनुभवी Engineers aim to connect these small businesses with retired engineers by matching the two based on the required help and the area of expertise respectively. Our goal is to allow these engineers to do freelancing work, gaining some personal income and using their experience to drive our economy forward.
